# Photo-Gallery-App
A photo gallery app using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js stack.
In this little project I built a photo gallery app using MERN stack. MongoDB was used for storing photos, so it was installed on the local machine. I was also able to learn:
1. How to upload and serve images or any other file and restrict it to a specific file extension
2. How to restrict file upload size
3. How to get server errors in the redux store and display them on the front-end
4. How to avoid returning un-necessarily large data from the server
5. How to deploy client and server code on the same server to run it on the same port

The project was initialised by using Create React App.
